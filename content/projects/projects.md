- Ring Oscillators

Desiging a PUF (Physically Unconneble device), as a part of the CEN 598 course.

> The Ring Oscillator(RO) PUF uses multiple Ring Oscillators to increment counters. Variations in fabrication mean that each RO will have a unique frequency. When two counters use different RO outputs as a clock, one counter will finish before the other. Checking which counter finished first provides a source of randomness unique to each device. Multiple PUF challenges are supported by providing several ROs to choose from when clocking each counter. Multiple PUF response bits are generated with multiple pairs of counters racing to the max count value.
