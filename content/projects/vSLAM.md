# An experimental comparison of visual SLAM systems

> The work shown in this paper was initially an attempt by my colleague and dear friend Rishikesh Madan, to find a platform & replacement of an open-source drone for teaching ROS, & control-theory back in June-July of 2020. Along with our superb interns, Suraj Mahangade & Aayushi Gautam, we published the investigation on the capabilities of the DJI-Tello drone's monocular camera, through different vSLAM implementations techniques, during the years 2010-2019.
