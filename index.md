## Work Experience

### Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India

> Position: Sr Project Technical Assistant 

> Duration: Dec 2018 – July 2022

Responsible for developing more than eight robotics & RTOS application under the supervision of Prof Kavi Arya, CSE Dept, IIT Bombay, to conceptualise them through 3 different teaching pedagogy.

- Led a team of 6 in the design & development of UGV (with UR5 mount) & drones (Quadcopters & Octocopters) for generic applications.

- Taught undergraduate students through designing & managing international robotics competitions, (eYRC) eYantra Robotics Competition. Curated 3 editions in the year 2019, 2020 & 2021 with 3675, 1771 & 897 students respectively.

- Created MOOCs in ROS & Embedded Systems, drone Simulation models in Gazebo & real applications for teaching & research purposes, with yearly 4000+ participants.

- Mentored 14 interns & guided them in various robotics projects in an annual internship program at (Embedded & Real-time Systems) ERTS Lab.

- Fortified auto-grading python scripts for efficient evaluation of 1000+ bag(log) files containing extensive telemetric data for the system’s
performance analysis.

- Developed & facilitated 2-day workshops on the topic “Introduction to Embedded Systems”. Trained 180+ college faculties from 65+ engineering colleges across India
